The Brave Monkey Pirate
Доблестный Пират Обезьян
One day the pirate Modi was out running errands with his mom.
They shopped for groceries and ate peas at his favorite restaurant.
Then the pirate Modi's mom said, "Oh yes, we need to
stop off at the doctor's office for a quick checkup."
The doctor checked Modi's heart, his blood pressure, and his knees.
